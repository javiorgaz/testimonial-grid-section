                    enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never wirtten a line of
                    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
                    help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
                    enroll by a former student of theirs whocan only sy
                    wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
                    and staff did not disappoint. They wre very hands-on and I
                    never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
                    project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
                    to hte next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
                    In fact, I've often referrred to it, during interviews as an
                    example of my development experience. It certainly helped me
                    land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
                    multiple offer. 100% recommend!"
